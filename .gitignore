# Twitter Bot Specific
# --- IMPORTANT: Credentials and sensitive data ---
# If you were to ever hardcode credentials for testing (NOT RECOMMENDED)
# credentials.py # THIS SHOULD NOT EXIST IF USER PROVIDES CREDS INTERACTIVELY
                  # OR IF IT CONTAINS TEMPLATES, ENSURE NO ACTUAL KEYS ARE COMMITTED.
                  # Since this bot is interactive, we don't need a credentials.py with live keys.

# --- Persistence files (These store runtime data, usually not for repo) ---
*.txt
# More specific if you prefer, but *.txt covers them all for this project:
# liked_tweet_ids_interactive.txt
# retweeted_tweet_ids_interactive.txt
# followed_user_ids_interactive.txt
# last_searched_id_interactive.txt

# --- Log files ---
*.log
# More specific:
# twitter_interactive_bot.log
# bot_activity.log # If you used this older name
